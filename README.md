# SpectralEnvelope
A Class project to try and demonstrate the fundamental frequency estimation and envelopes of the Cepstrum.

Requires the following libraries to be installed:
*numpy
*matplotlib
*sounddevices

Used and included for convenience in the repository are:

https://github.com/python-acoustics/python-acoustics/blob/master/acoustics/cepstrum.py

https://gist.github.com/endolith/25086

The fundamental estimation works for the power cepstrum, but not the complex cepstrum. 

Note: Audio playback of the cepstrum/filter/source is not good, which is probably expected, but perhaps a problem.
